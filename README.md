### This page will be updated with the code and the dataset of "Limitations of weak labels for embedding and tagging".

I am currently releasing the dataset for dcase 2019 task 4 ([https://github.com/turpaultn/Desed_synthetic](https://github.com/turpaultn/Desed_synthetic)) because the dataset we used is derived from it.

Sorry for the inconvenience if you see the current page, it will be updated soon.
